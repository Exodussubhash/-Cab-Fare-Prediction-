# -Cab-Fare-Prediction-
Problem Statement : You are a cab rental start-up company. You have successfully run the pilot project and now want to launch your cab service across the country. You have collected the historical data from your pilot project and now have a requirement to apply analytics for fare prediction. You need to design a system that predicts the fare amount for a cab ride in the city. 


Description : Train data was given with details as pick up and drop in the format of latitude,longitude,passenger details etc..Followed Exploratory data analysis to calculate distance of the cab travelled from basic details like pickup latitude,drop off latitude and used Regression techniques by machine learning algorithms. Algorithms were developed from basic linear regression to standard Random forest methods for prediction of cost. Predicted the fare amount on test data set provided . Calculated error metrics as per regression error standards .Implemented right visuals which explains the dimension-ed data from histograms, scatter plots etc.Distribution plots were used to compare actual and predicted values.
